## Quick Guidelines
- This spec describes WHAT the storage backend must do and WHY. Implementation-level details, exact APIs, and internal code layout belong to the implementation plan and tasks, not the spec.
- This feature is explicitly scoped to local (SQLite) TaskChampion usage via the taskchampion crate (Replica, StorageConfig, Operations). Remote servers, network protocols, and syncing across machines are out of scope for this feature.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer uses the Taskwarrior 3 Rust library and wants a default, production-ready storage backend that uses the taskchampion crate to operate against a local SQLite-backed TaskChampion replica (the on-disk Task data store). They expect parity with FileStorageBackend behavior (read, write, query, filters, contexts) and minimal API changes when swapping backends.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given an on-disk TaskChampion replica directory (Task data files), when the library initializes with default storage, then it must open an on-disk Replica via taskchampion::storage::StorageConfig::OnDisk and read tasks into memory.
2. Given a sequence of task create/update/delete operations performed through the library, when operations are committed, then the Replica must persist those changes to the local TaskChampion database and subsequent reads must reflect them.
3. Given concurrent readers and writers to the same local replica, operations must use the taskchampion Replica APIs and surface errors appropriately (e.g., file locks, IO errors) without silent data loss.
4. Given the FileStorageBackend and TaskChampion backend, when run through the same integration quickstart (on the same dataset), observable behavior (queries, contexts, filters, write_filter semantics) must match.

### Edge Cases
- File lock contention or IO permission errors when accessing the local TaskChampion database.
- Schema mismatches or incompatible TaskChampion database versions on disk.
- Large task volumes and performance/pagination implications for local reads and queries.
- Partial failures during multi-step operations (e.g., creating a task and adding annotations) where atomicity must be considered at the Replica/Operations level.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The library MUST provide a storage implementation that uses the taskchampion crate (Replica/StorageConfig/Operations) to read tasks from and persist changes to a local SQLite TaskChampion replica.
- **FR-002**: The TaskChampion backend MUST be the default storage implementation when a local Replica path is available or configured at runtime.
- **FR-003**: The storage implementation MUST support read, create, update, delete operations for tasks, annotations, and task metadata supported by TaskChampion.
- **FR-004**: The storage implementation MUST respect existing library semantics (filters, contexts, write_filter behavior, and composition) — behavior must be consistent with current FileStorageBackend.
- **FR-005**: The implementation MUST expose clear, typed errors (TaskError variants) for IO, locking, schema, and data validation failures.
- **FR-006**: The implementation MUST include contract tests and integration tests that validate parity with FileStorageBackend for common operations and context-aware features using local replicas.
- **FR-007**: Configuration MUST allow setting local replica parameters (on-disk path, access mode: ReadOnly/ReadWrite) and simple retry/backoff policies for transient IO errors.
- **FR-008**: The implementation MUST support graceful shutdown and ensure pending Operations are committed to the local replica before exit.
- **FR-009**: The implementation MUST not perform destructive migrations without explicit opt-in and documentation.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Performance: Read-heavy workloads should not be significantly slower than FileStorageBackend for typical task sets (tolerance: <20% regression on local disk access).
- **NFR-002**: Security: File permissions and XDG paths must be respected; sensitive paths must not be logged.
- **NFR-003**: Reliability: Provide configurable retry/backoff for transient IO errors (e.g., temporary file locks) and clear failure modes for persistent errors.
- **NFR-004**: Observability: Emit structured logs on key events (open replica, commit operations, errors) with adjustable verbosity.

## Key Entities
- **StorageBackend (trait)**: Abstraction implemented by FileStorageBackend and TaskChampionBackend; operations: initialize, save_task, load_task, delete_task, load_all_tasks, query_tasks, backup, restore.
- **ReplicaWrapper**: Lightweight wrapper around `taskchampion::Replica` and `taskchampion::storage::StorageConfig` to encapsulate on-disk configuration and access modes.
- **OperationBatch**: Represents a set of `taskchampion::Operations` to be committed as part of a save/update action; used to ensure unit-of-work behavior.
