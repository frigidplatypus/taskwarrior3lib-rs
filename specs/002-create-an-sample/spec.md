# Feature Specification: Sample Project for Taskwarrior Library

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-an-sample`  
**Created**: September 18, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create an sample project that utilizes the library to implement and fully test creating, modifying, adding, and completing tasks in taskwarrior with the library"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature involves creating a sample project for library validation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: sample project, library utilization, CRUD operations (create, modify, add, complete), testing
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Sample project scope [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: CLI app, web app, or simple script?]
   ‚Üí Testing approach [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: unit tests, integration tests, or manual testing?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow for task management operations
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer evaluating the Taskwarrior library, I want a sample project that demonstrates all core task management operations so that I can verify the library works correctly and serves as a reference for my own implementations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new sample project, **When** I run the project to create a task, **Then** the task is successfully added to the task storage
2. **Given** an existing task in storage, **When** I run the project to modify the task, **Then** the task is updated with the new information
3. **Given** an existing task in storage, **When** I run the project to complete the task, **Then** the task status changes to completed
4. **Given** multiple tasks in storage, **When** I run the project to list tasks, **Then** all tasks are displayed with their current information

### Edge Cases

The sample project will rely on the Taskwarrior library's built-in error handling for edge cases:

- **Non-existent task modification**: Library returns appropriate error when task ID not found
- **Invalid task data**: Library validates input data and returns validation errors
- **Already completed task**: Library handles completion of completed tasks appropriately
- **Empty storage**: Library gracefully handles queries on empty datasets

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Sample project MUST demonstrate task creation with all required fields
- **FR-002**: Sample project MUST demonstrate task modification with field updates
- **FR-003**: Sample project MUST demonstrate task completion functionality
- **FR-004**: Sample project MUST demonstrate task listing and querying
- **FR-005**: Sample project MUST demonstrate library error handling by showing how errors are propagated and displayed to users
- **FR-006**: Sample project MUST validate all library operations work correctly
- **FR-007**: Sample project MUST serve as reference implementation for library usage
- **FR-008**: Sample project MUST demonstrate library's edge case handling through intentional error scenarios
- **FR-009**: Sample project MUST include comprehensive test coverage [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What type of tests - unit, integration, manual?]
- **FR-010**: Sample project MUST be runnable and demonstrate real functionality [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What format - CLI, web interface, or simple script?]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Task**: Represents a task item with properties like description, status, priority, due date, and project
- **Task Manager**: Handles operations on tasks including creation, modification, completion, and querying
- **Storage Backend**: Manages persistence of task data
- **Configuration**: Defines settings for task storage and library behavior
