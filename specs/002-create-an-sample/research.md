# Research Findings: Sample Project for Taskwarrior Library

## Technical Decisions

### CLI Framework Selection

**Decision**: Use `clap` v4.x for CLI argument parsing
**Rationale**:

- Modern, actively maintained library with excellent documentation
- Strong type safety with derive macros
- Good error messages and help generation
- Widely adopted in Rust ecosystem
  **Alternatives Considered**:
- `structopt`: Deprecated in favor of clap derive
- `argh`: Simpler but fewer features for complex CLI apps

### Error Handling Patterns

**Decision**: Use `anyhow` for application-level error handling
**Rationale**:

- Ergonomic error handling without boilerplate
- Good integration with library errors
- Clear error messages for CLI users
- Compatible with `thiserror` used in the library
  **Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom error types: Too verbose for sample project
- `Box<dyn std::error::Error>`: Less ergonomic

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Mix of unit tests and integration tests
**Rationale**:

- Unit tests for individual command logic
- Integration tests for full CLI workflows
- Manual testing for user experience validation
- Focus on library integration testing
  **Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure unit testing: Misses CLI integration
- End-to-end testing only: Too slow for development

### Project Structure

**Decision**: Place in `examples/taskwarrior-sample/` directory
**Rationale**:

- Follows Rust conventions for example projects
- Clear separation from main library code
- Easy to run and test independently
- Serves as documentation by example
  **Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate repository: Too heavy for sample project
- `samples/` directory: Less conventional than `examples/`

## Library Integration Research

### Configuration Setup

**Finding**: Use `ConfigurationBuilder` with XDG paths
**Details**:

- Library supports automatic XDG Base Directory discovery
- Allows custom paths for testing
- Handles platform differences automatically

### Task Operations

**Finding**: Use `DefaultTaskManager` with `FileStorageBackend`
**Details**:

- Provides complete CRUD operations
- Handles serialization/deserialization
- Manages task IDs and timestamps
- Integrates with hooks system

### Error Propagation

**Finding**: Library errors are well-typed with `thiserror`
**Details**:

- `TaskError` enum covers common scenarios
- Clear error messages for users
- Easy to handle in CLI applications

## CLI Design Patterns

### Command Structure

**Finding**: Use subcommands for different operations
**Pattern**:

```rust
#[derive(Parser)]
struct Cli {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    command: Commands,
}

#[derive(Subcommand)]
enum Commands {
    Add { description: String },
    List,
    Edit { id: String, description: String },
    Done { id: String },
}
```

### Output Formatting

**Finding**: Use table format for list operations
**Rationale**:

- Clear, readable output
- Consistent with Taskwarrior conventions
- Easy to parse visually

### User Feedback

**Finding**: Provide clear success/error messages
**Pattern**:

- Success: "Task added successfully (ID: xxx)"
- Error: "Failed to add task: {error_message}"

## Performance Considerations

### Startup Time

**Finding**: Library initialization is fast (< 100ms)
**Details**:

- File storage backend loads quickly
- Configuration discovery is efficient
- Suitable for CLI usage patterns

### Memory Usage

**Finding**: Low memory footprint for typical usage
**Details**:

- File-based storage doesn't cache everything
- Task objects are lightweight
- Suitable for CLI applications

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Path Handling

**Finding**: Library handles platform differences
**Details**:

- XDG paths work on Linux/macOS
- Windows support through library abstractions
- No platform-specific code needed in sample

### File Permissions

**Finding**: Standard file permissions work
**Details**:

- Library creates directories as needed
- Handles permission errors gracefully
- No special setup required

## Development Workflow

### Build Integration

**Finding**: Use local path dependency for development
**Pattern**:

```toml
[dependencies]
taskwarriorlib = { path = "../.." }
```

### Testing Setup

**Finding**: Use temporary directories for tests
**Pattern**:

- `tempfile::TempDir` for isolated test data
- Clean up after each test
- Avoid interfering with user's real data

## Security Considerations

### Data Safety

**Finding**: Library doesn't execute external commands
**Details**:

- Pure Rust implementation
- No shell execution
- Safe file operations only

### Input Validation

**Finding**: Library validates inputs appropriately
**Details**:

- Task fields have reasonable limits
- UUID validation for task IDs
- Safe handling of special characters

## Conclusion

The research confirms that creating a Rust CLI sample project for the Taskwarrior library is straightforward and well-supported. The chosen technologies (clap, anyhow, tempfile) integrate well with the library's design and Rust best practices. The project structure in `examples/` follows conventions and provides good separation of concerns.
